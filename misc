. Protect Endpoints & Implement Authorization
Add Depends(get_current_user) or similar to endpoints that should require authentication.
Implement role-based access (e.g., admin vs. user) if your app needs it.
2. User Registration & Profile Management
Add /auth/register if not already there.
Allow users to update their profile info, reset passwords, etc.
3. Build Out Main App Features
Start developing the core features of your app (e.g., CRUD for your main models).
4. Input Validation & Error Handling
Use Pydantic models for request and response schemas.
Add clear error messages and exception handlers.
5. Testing
Write unit and integration tests for your auth and main endpoints.
Try pytest and httpx for API testing.
6. API Documentation
Use FastAPIâ€™s automatic docs at /docs and /redoc.
Add summaries, descriptions, and examples to your endpoints.
7. Security Enhancements
Hash and salt passwords (you may already be doing this).
Use HTTPS in production.
Set proper CORS policies.
8. Database Migrations
Set up Alembic for managing schema changes.
9. Deployment Prep
Prepare for deployment (Dockerfile, production settings, gunicorn, etc.).
Set up CI/CD if needed.
10. Frontend Integration
If you have a frontend, integrate it with your API and test flows (login, register, protected routes).
